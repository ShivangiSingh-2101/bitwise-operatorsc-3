Program 4(1)
 Aim:
To perform bitwise operations (AND, OR, XOR, NOT, Left Shift, Right Shift) on two integers using C++ and display the results.

Theory:
Bitwise operators operate directly on the binary representation of integers. They are used in low-level programming, device drivers, and performance-sensitive applications.

Algorithm:

Start the program.
Include the iostream header and use the std namespace.
Declare and initialize two integers: a = 21, b = 18.
Perform and store results of the following operations:
a & b, a | b, a ^ b
~a, ~b
a << 1, b << 1
a >> 1, b >> 1
Display all results using cout.
End the program.
